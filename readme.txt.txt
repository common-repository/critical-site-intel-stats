Get the Critical Site Stats you need to know in order to improve your site load time and determine exactly how long site visitors engage with your website.

== Description ==

**Critical Site Intel** gives you the essential information you need to know about your website. There are no profiles to setup, no tricky settings to configure, and no complicated terms you need to learn. Just install and watch as your site data accumulates and reveals exactly:

* How long your pages take to load.
* The time your visitors spend on each page.
* The country sending you the most traffic.

The real value in those stats is seeing them in combination so you can determine which country sends you the most traffic, how quickly your site loads for those visitors, and how long those visitors spend on your website.

You may find that some pages on your website get more engagement than others. You might also be shocked to find out exactly how long visitors are staying on your pages. Either way, this plugin presents you with the opportunity to improve those statistics and ultimately build a better site that ranks higher in the search engines, and generates you more revenue.
